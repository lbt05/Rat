This is just clojure project for self-learning

As my plan, This project will include two kinds of process.
One is the Server, another is the client.
Client have to register the name on the Server and then can get name list as other running client from Server.
After that the Client can start conversation between others.

Server should handle the request from Client and dispatch the conversation between Client servers.


Here are the points I need to think over:
1.multi-process on Server side to process concurrent request from Client
2. How many process needed for Client, Maybe one just running to accept response from Client, one to send the request and one to interact with user.


These are my plan , and I think the development will be after schedule sometimes but I will try my best to be not.
